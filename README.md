An age calculator is a program or tool that determines a person's current age based on their date of birth (DOB). Here's a brief explanation of how an age calculator works:

Input DOB: The user provides the program with their date of birth. The DOB is typically entered in a specific format, such as YYYY-MM-DD.

Current Date Retrieval: The program retrieves the current date. This information is essential for calculating the time difference between the birthdate and the present date.

Date Calculation: The program calculates the difference between the current date and the provided date of birth. This calculation involves subtracting the birthdate from the current date to determine the number of years, months, and days.

Age Presentation: The calculated age is then presented to the user. This may include the total number of years, months, and days, or it may be simplified to just the total years.
